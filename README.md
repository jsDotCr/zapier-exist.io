# Zapier vs. Exist.io

Exist.io integration for Zapier platform.
Not much going on for the time being, but still, it's a fun one for me!

## Scope

The scope is currently limited to logging `body fat`, `heart rate`, `meditation` and `weight` attributes for a given date.


## Development notes

* `npm i` to install dependencies
* `npm t` to run the tests
